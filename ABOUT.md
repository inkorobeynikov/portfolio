## Summary

I build and stabilize complex frontend systems: from greenfield launches and architectural decisions to refactoring legacy codebases and creating internal tooling that speeds up delivery. I can work hands-on and also drive architecture, standards, and team processes.

# Selected Case Study (Featured)

## Learning Bot — Language learning platform (Telegram bot + web app)

**Type:** Pet / R&D / architecture demo  
**Status:** active / evolving  
**Links:**

- Demo: <add-link>
- Repo: <add-link> (or “private”)
- Screenshots: <add-folder-or-links>

### What it is

Learning Bot is a language learning product built around vocabulary acquisition and spaced repetition. It consists of:

- a Telegram bot (user interaction + daily flows)
- a Node.js backend (logic, scheduling, storage, APIs)
- a web application (Telegram Mini App / web UI for learning and reviewing)

### Why I built it

- To build a real product end-to-end and iterate quickly
- To validate learning mechanics (spaced repetition + interactive exercises)
- To create a platform for multilingual expansion and experimentation
- To demonstrate fullstack architecture and automation skills

### My role

Solo builder: product, architecture, backend, bot logic, frontend, infrastructure.

### Key features

- Vocabulary ingestion and learning flows
- Spaced repetition scheduling (review queue logic)
- Multiple exercise types (e.g., recognition/recall-style tasks)
- Multilingual support (scalable by design)
- Admin / operational tooling (as needed for growth)
- Automation-friendly architecture (scheduled jobs, daily content delivery, etc.)

### Architecture (high level)

**Client layer**

- Telegram bot UI for user communication and nudges
- Web app UI for interactive learning and review sessions

**Backend layer**

- Node.js service for:
  - user state and progress tracking
  - spaced repetition scheduling
  - content pipeline (generation/import)
  - API for the web app

**Data layer**

- Storage based on MongoDB/Supabase (depending on module) for:
  - users, progress, decks, review logs
  - content entities (words, translations, metadata)

**Delivery/DevOps**

- CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Deployments on Vercel (web) and server hosting for backend/bot
- Environment-based configuration for multi-app / multi-language scaling

### Technical highlights (what this demonstrates)

- Fullstack delivery (bot + backend + web app)
- Architecture thinking: modularity, scalability, environment-driven setup
- Real-world constraints: scheduling, state machines, user flows
- Automation and operational readiness (deployments, envs, logs)
- Product iteration speed using AI-assisted development

### Results / current outcomes

- Working end-to-end system (bot + web app + backend)
- A foundation for expansion into multiple languages and exercise formats
- A reusable architecture for other bot-based products

### What I would improve / next steps (optional)

- More analytics around retention and review effectiveness
- More exercise variations and adaptive difficulty
- Better admin UI for content ops and messaging
- Expanded i18n and per-user timezone scheduling for notifications
